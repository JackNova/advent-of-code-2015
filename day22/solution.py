# --- Day 22: Wizard Simulator 20XX ---

# Little Henry Case decides that defeating bosses with swords and stuff is boring.
# Now he's playing the game with a wizard.
# Of course, he gets stuck on another boss and needs your help again.

# In this version, combat still proceeds with the player and the boss taking alternating turns.
# The player still goes first. Now, however, you don't get any equipment;
# instead, you must choose one of your spells to cast.
# The first character at or below 0 hit points loses.


# Since you're a wizard, you don't get to wear armor, and you can't attack normally.
# However, since you do magic damage, your opponent's armor is ignored,
# and so the boss effectively has zero armor as well. As before,
# if armor (from a spell, in this case) would reduce damage below 1, it becomes 1 instead
# - that is, the boss' attacks always deal at least 1 damage.

# On each of your turns, you must select one of your spells to cast.
# If you cannot afford to cast any spell, you lose.
# Spells cost mana; you start with 500 mana, but have no maximum limit.
# You must have enough mana to cast a spell, and its cost is immediately deducted when you cast it.
# Your spells are Magic Missile, Drain, Shield, Poison, and Recharge.
